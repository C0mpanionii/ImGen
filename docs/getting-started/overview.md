cd image-generation-workspace

# Set up the anime wallpaper remaster project
cd anime-wallpaper-remaster
python install.py

# Run the application
python -m anime_wallpaper_remaster
```

### Option 2: Docker Deployment

Best for production and quick testing:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd image-generation-workspace

# Run with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d

# Access the application
open http://localhost:8080
```

### Option 3: Pre-built Releases

## 🚨 Important Notes

!!! warning "GPU Requirements"
    While the system can run on CPU, GPU acceleration is strongly recommended for practical usage. CUDA-compatible GPUs will provide significantly better performance.

!!! info "Model Downloads"
    The first run will download several GB of AI models. Ensure you have a stable internet connection and sufficient disk space.

!!! tip "Performance Optimization"
    For best results, allocate at least 8GB of GPU memory and ensure adequate cooling for sustained workloads.
