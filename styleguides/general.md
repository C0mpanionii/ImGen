# General Style Guide

This document outlines general coding standards that apply to all languages in this project.

## File Organization

### Directory Structure
- Use lowercase with hyphens for directory names (e.g., `user-service`, `config-files`)
- Group related files in appropriate directories
- Keep the root directory clean and organized

### File Naming
- Use descriptive, meaningful names
- Follow language-specific conventions for file naming
- Include appropriate file extensions

### File Headers
Include a header comment in source files when appropriate:
```
/**
 * Brief description of the file's purpose
 * 
 * @author Your Name
 * @date Creation date
 */
```

## Code Organization

### Imports/Includes
- Group imports logically (standard library, third-party, local)
- Sort imports alphabetically within each group
- Remove unused imports

### Function and Class Organization
- Place public methods before private methods
- Group related functionality together
- Use consistent ordering across files

## Naming Conventions

### Variables and Functions
- Use descriptive names that clearly indicate purpose
- Avoid abbreviations unless they're well-known
- Use consistent naming patterns throughout the project

### Constants
- Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants
- Define constants at the top of files or in dedicated configuration files

### Comments
- Write clear, concise comments
- Explain "why" rather than "what" when possible
- Keep comments up-to-date with code changes
- Use complete sentences with proper grammar

## Code Quality

### Error Handling
- Handle errors appropriately for each language
- Use specific error types when available
- Include meaningful error messages
- Log errors at appropriate levels

### Performance
- Write efficient code without premature optimization
- Use appropriate data structures
- Avoid unnecessary operations in loops
- Consider memory usage for large datasets

### Security
- Validate all input data
- Use parameterized queries for database operations
- Sanitize output when rendering user data
- Follow security best practices for authentication and authorization

## Testing

### Test Organization
- Mirror the source code structure in test directories
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Group related tests together

### Test Quality
- Write tests that are independent and can run in any order
- Use meaningful assertions
- Test both positive and negative cases
- Include edge cases and boundary conditions

## Documentation

### Code Documentation
- Document public APIs thoroughly
- Include usage examples where helpful
- Keep documentation close to the code it describes

### README Files
- Include README files in directories when appropriate
- Explain the purpose and usage of modules or components
- Provide setup and usage instructions

## Version Control

### Commit Messages
- Follow the Conventional Commits specification
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Keep commits focused on a single change
- Reference related issues when applicable

### Branch Names
- Use descriptive branch names
- Follow the pattern: `type/description` (e.g., `feature/user-authentication`)
- Use kebab-case for multi-word descriptions

## Code Review

### Before Submitting
- Review your own code first
- Ensure all tests pass
- Check for code formatting issues
- Verify that documentation is updated

### Review Process
- Be constructive in code reviews
- Focus on code quality, not personal preferences
- Ask questions when something is unclear
- Acknowledge good practices and improvements

## Tools and Automation

### Linting
- Use appropriate linters for each language
- Configure linters to enforce project standards
- Address linting issues before committing

### Formatting
- Use consistent code formatting
- Configure auto-formatting in your editor
- Run formatters before committing changes

### Continuous Integration
- Ensure all CI checks pass
- Fix any issues identified by automated tools
- Keep build times reasonable
